#My docker-compose setups

##Intro

Why I do this project ? Because most of time when you want to test an application, you can find a docker image but to setup a whole environment, you have to do it on your own.

With docker-compose, you should be able to setup a complete environment without effort. So when I can't find a complete setup, and I've to spend time on it, I share it with you.
