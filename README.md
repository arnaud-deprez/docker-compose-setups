#Some docker-compose setups

##Intro

Why I do this project ? Because most of time when you want to test an application, you can find a docker image but to setup a whole environment, you have to do it on your own.

With docker-compose, you should be able to setup a complete environment without effort. So when I can't find a complete setup, and I've to spend time on it, I share it with you.

##Environments

* [Kafka](https://github.com/wurstmeister/kafka-docker)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/vyshane/docker-compose-kubernetes) running on docker
* [Odoo](./odoo/README.md)(formerly known as OpenERP)
